This is of course great, brings monetary benefit to numbers of developers and companies but at times we ask ourselves what is the PURPOSE. Technological development has enabled us to tackle various societal problems and find tangible solutions starting from inventing complicated machines or hardware to websites for online donations.

The session will start with a brief introduction of the topic and proceed into dynamic design thinking. I'm hoping there will be at least one take away message for everyone attending it!"
